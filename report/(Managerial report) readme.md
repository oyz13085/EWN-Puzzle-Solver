## 🛠️ Challenges & Solutions

| Problem | Solutions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Difficulty connecting `GameMain`, `GameLoader`, and `Player` classes** | • Divided work by class structure (one member focused on `GameLoader`, others on Player logic).<br>• Communicated between teammates to ensure the required methods were implemented.<br>• Utilized resources (W3Schools, YouTube) to understand class inheritance and polymorphism.<br>• Sought guidance from seniors to debug the `GameMain` loop. |
| **Confusion with implementing polymorphism and class inheritance** | • Restudied class inheritance and polymorphism using W3Schools and YouTube.<br>• Focused on ensuring the correct method overriding in subclasses. |
| **Challenging file parsing logic in `GameLoader`** | • Dedicated one member to focus solely on file input logic in `GameLoader`.<br>• Debugged and tested file reading line-by-line to ensure correct interpretation. |
| **Standard arrays are insufficient for dynamic lists of moves** | • Restudied and implemented `ArrayLists` to manage the variable number of possible moves generated during each turn. |
